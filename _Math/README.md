AI Engineering is not about tools — it’s about mathematics.
The one who truly understands the math behind AI is the real engineer.

In this folder, I’m uploading complete mathematical foundations for AI —
from linear algebra to probability, statistics, optimization, and core concepts that power real models.

This is not shortcut learning.
This is engineering-level understanding.
